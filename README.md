- 👋 Hi, I’m John!
- 👀 I’m interested in soccer, fly fishing, skiing, and tinkering in web development to hopefully one day make a full-time job out of it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... to code and trying to improve.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... we'll see, maybe a skiing app or a fishing one.
- 📫 How to reach me ... check out my portfolio for email and LinkedIn.
